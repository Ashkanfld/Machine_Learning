# Machine_Learning 

This simple program computes a multiple linear regression based on Gradient Descent as an optimization method. 

# Sample_dataset

This code could be used for a vast majority of datasets, one of which is provided in the result section. This dataset could be found on the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/data-for-admission-in-the-university)

A multiple linear regression is derived based on 70 percent of participants as the Training Set, and the remaining 30 percent is used to verify the model as the Test Set.

# How to use

1) Download a Python file ("Code.py")

2) Insert the Training Set (CSV format) in the " importData " function as input.

3) Determine a file path for the total cost in the " reportTotalCost " function.  

4) Determine a file path for the final coefficients in multiple linear regression in the " reportTheta " function.

5) Determine a file path for the Test Set to predict its result and also a file path for reporting the result in the " findAnswer " function.  

6) Run the program



# Importing dataset

 the dataset file must be specified in the CSV data format.

A wide range of real datasets (in CSV format) is available at data science websites such as Kaggle (www.kaggle.com).
